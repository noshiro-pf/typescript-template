/**
 * Mapping from source files to their sample code files. Sample files should be
 * listed in the order they appear in the source file's JSDoc.
 *
 * HOW TO USE:
 *
 * 1. In the source file JSDoc, add @example blocks:
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * ```
 *
 * 2. Add the source file path and its sample files to this mapping in the order
 *   they appear in the source file (top to bottom).
 *
 * 3. Run: pnpm run doc:embed:jsdoc (or pnpm exec tsx scripts/cmd/embed-examples-in-jsdoc.mts)
 *
 * The script will replace each ```ts block sequentially with the corresponding sample code.
